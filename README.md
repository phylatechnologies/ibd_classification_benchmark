All scripts required to run the leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) cross-validation are contained in this repository. In order to run the full pipeline, modify the run_experiment.py file to the required data preprocessing and machine learning components and then run from command line `python3 run_experiment.py`

Requires the QIIME2-2020.2 conda environment with Tensorflow 2 and XGBoost packages added.
